The "Airshow Simulation Project" is a computer graphics and visualization project
that aims to simulate an air show environment using various techniques and algorithms. The
project involves creating a 3D virtual environment that includes a runway, aircraft, and
various other objects. The aircrafts are modeled using 3D modeling software and are
animated using keyframe animation techniques.
